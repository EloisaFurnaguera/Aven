## Aven Homepage Mockup
Using only html and css, this page is designed to match the Adobe mockup sent as my takehome exercise.

The layout matches when the pages are static and is responsive to resizing of the window, shifting to phone layout when the browser window narrows enough. The fonts are as nearly matching as possible from free font options; they are not quite identical but the differences are subtle.

This project was made by Eloisa Furnaguera and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/EloisaFurnaguera/Aven)
